That'll give some sense of what was in my feelings as
I wrote the main piece (tout-le-monde-a.txt) earlier
in the evening (which was intended also, as the intial
README.md for this repository on github).

There's other stuff that was present in me, as well. ;)

ENiD,

tout-le-monde-a.txt

   Hi.  My name is Christopher.  I go by Christopher.velo in a
few social media circuits.  Hello!

 - - -

   I would like, for the youngest people reading this, to take
away just one thing, especially: that there is an opportunity
here, right now, for new (and very young) leadership to
emerge, in our (and this means everywhere) society.

   That means things like teaching opportunities; expression of
your own view, on things that really affect all of our futures.

   At this very moment, the entire world's attention is focused,
almost without exception, on things that are common to that
entire world.  And by world, I am (of course) being somewhat
specie-ist in that it is, this world, composed of (minimally)
decision-making primates (people) and their (minimally) higher-
order mammal pets (dogs, especially).

   Now the dogs don't make the sorts of decisions I have in my
mind as I write this, so they are taken as a kind of dependent
'person' (if you will) much like a very young child (say, aged 3-5)
who is wholly a kind of 'client' to the older person (even an
eleven year old who comes each day, to feed the dog while their
neighbor is away on vacation, say).

   I'm talking about decision-makers.  By definition, if you are
reading this *at all* that includes you, specifically, as you are
in fact a decision-maker (your decisions impact, if 'nobody else'
the pet animals in your life, and also very small children (you
would immediately move to protect any one of them if they wandered
into traffic, right?  You just made a decision a squirrel, for
example, could not even in principle, make or be concerned with).

   So every one of 'us' (the decision-makers) are, at a minimum,
above a squirrel all the way to an (say) eleven year old, in our
ability to intervene; to protect, and also to serve .. all those
other younger (or 'lesser' in the case of the dog) dependents.

   Not that dogs cannot be heroes .. they sure can (and have been,
countless times, and you may be able to think of a personal instance
where you have seen this, your own self).

   So.  Heroes, every one of us, potentially.  Again: 'us' here
implies anyone reading this document!

 - - -

   You might well think: well, what can I do, personally?  How can
I help .. how can I serve the world .. personally?

   When you grabbed that little kid's hand, and led them out of the
way of moving automobile traffic, you just made a *huge* difference
in the life-story of that one person.  That is now in your 'to the good'
column on your personal balance sheet: you made a real difference in
that one person's life.
   This is also the case when you managed to attract a stray (friendly)
dog, got it by the harness (or collar) it was wearing, perhaps by a
little trick (you held out a tasty piece of ham to it, and it came
right to you, to get it! Which was when you got its harness and led it
back to safety, out of concern for the animal's welfare, only).


  Each of us is able, not to change the world, especially, but to make
a real (sometimes profound) difference in the life of at least one other
person (here including dogs or other pets we see as kinds of 'persons',
for a somewhat wider and relatable talking point).

  And that's the whole thing.

  No, maybe you cannot change the world, but you can make a difference,
very real, in the life of those close to you in your life.

  So of course that leads one to consider that there are others in our
personal acquaintance that we might want, especially, to be helpful
towards.  Even when feeling alienated (sometimes a little; for some folks,
quite a bit) there's probably someone you know you'd like to be of some
small benefit to, with really nothing in mind for a reciprocation - you
don't really care if they reciprocate, and you might not even mind it all
that much if they were somewhat ungrateful to you for having made your
gesture (a kind of 'frienemy' as a new term I've just encountered, as
of late!)

  I had a few frienemies who later became some of my very closest friends.
I can think of two right now. ;)
