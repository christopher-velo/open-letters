So, the flu got me.

In 2013, at the New Year, I'd been self-isolating against
contracting flu virus, as I often had done at that time of
the winter.

The social circles I travel in (in warmer weather) tend to
be flu carriers.  I had not yet developed the habit of seeking
a flu vaccine at the beginning of the flu season (generally,
around the end of October).


END.
