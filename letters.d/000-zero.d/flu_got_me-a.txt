So, the flu got me.

In 2013, at the New Year, I'd been self-isolating against
contracting flu virus, as I often had done at that time of
the winter.

The social circles I travel in (in warmer weather) tend to
be flu carriers.  I had not yet developed the habit of seeking
a flu vaccine at the beginning of the flu season (generally,
around the end of October).

Right around the first of January, 2014, I get food delivered
to my door - a regional company that offers full grocery
delivery service, with online shopping.

Two days later I'm laying face down on my bed, trying not to
move; trying to stay asleep .. for the following 48 hours.
Intense chest pain, which (much later, in retrospect) turns
out to be some form of pericarditis.

That affects the pericardium, which is kind of a separate organ
from the heart, itself, but surrounds it.

After the 48 hours of wondering if I was going to die in my
sleep; wondering why I wasn't seeking medical help, I get just
enough better to get a good amount of water in me, maybe a
little bite, and back to bed, but not quite so awful.


I ran a fever for a good ten days, which is very long for me;
cannot remember a fever like this one, since childhood (and
I've had some fairly bad influenza symptoms in the past decade
or so).



END.
