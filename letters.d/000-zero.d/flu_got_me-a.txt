So, the flu got me.

In 2013, at the New Year, I'd been self-isolating against
contracting flu virus, as I often had done at that time of
the winter.

The social circles I travel in (in warmer weather) tend to
be flu carriers.  I had not yet developed the habit of seeking
a flu vaccine at the beginning of the flu season (generally,
around the end of October).

Right around the first of January, 2014, I get food delivered
to my door - a regional company that offers full grocery
delivery service, with online shopping.

Two days later I'm laying face down on my bed, trying not to
move; trying to stay asleep .. for the following 48 hours.
Intense chest pain, which (much later, in retrospect) turns
out to be some form of pericarditis.

That affects the pericardium, which is kind of a separate organ
from the heart, itself, but surrounds it.

After the 48 hours of wondering if I was going to die in my
sleep; wondering why I wasn't seeking medical help, I get just
enough better to get a good amount of water in me, maybe a
little bite, and back to bed, but not quite so awful.


I ran a fever for a good ten days, which is very long for me;
cannot remember a fever like this one, since childhood (and
I've had some fairly bad influenza symptoms in the past decade
or so).

I tracked the ibuprofen and the acetaminophen I was dosing with
(both, alternating, as I remember it) and so I had that much to
report semi-accurately when I was finally seen (in June!)

Yeah, I waited that long to seek help.

January came and went; first with the fever, and then with a really
difficult time breathing well.  I don't remember that much about
it; I do remember doing my usual walk around the neighborhood, maybe
3/4 mile (I don't know) .. a walk I wouldn't even consider, on an
athletic basis, to be the least wanting to prep for, or to put
off until I was feeling exceptionally well, when I was (formerly)
in my usual state of health (really pretty good overall).

It was cold outdoors in late January and early February, and it felt
like I had a basketball inside me, taking up all the space where the
lower half of my lungs were supposed to expand into.

That was the one time I remember trying to walk around the neighborhood;
I may've tried it a few times.

Ultimately (here's the wrong thing) I decided I had emphysema.  Now
they call that COPD, or at least the two were/are similar ideas.

I look it up online (still wrong) and learn that COPD spectrum type
stuff (there's your technical limit of the jargon, almost, showing
how little I know from rote, on this) .. I look it up and it says
that the condition is sensitive to sodium intake, and suggests lowering
sodium intake to .. feel better.

So I try that and quickly realize that weight gain was mapping pretty
consistently to higher daily sodium intake.

I make real effort to limit sodium (I didn't have the resources or
skills to reduce it entirely, but I was now in a range where my system
was responding to the reduction).



END.
