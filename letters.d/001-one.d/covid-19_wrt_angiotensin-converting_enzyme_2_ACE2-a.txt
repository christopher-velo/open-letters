A few sample references demonstrating current view on COVID-19 transmission vector.

".. the predisposition of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV receptor."

".. the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor."

Professor Penninger’s lecture “ACE2 – a rational frontline therapy for COVID-19” aims to shed light on the discovery and function of ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). The lecture will also cover the relationship between ACE2 and renin–angiotensin system (RAS) – a hormone system responsible for systemic vascular resistance and for regulating blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance – in instances of lung injury. Furthermore, the lecture will highlight the predisposition of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.

Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV.

Scientists demonstrate how COVID-19 infects human cells
Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
