A few sample references demonstrating current view on COVID-19 transmission vector.

".. the predisposition of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV receptor."

".. the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor."

Professor Penninger’s lecture “ACE2 – a rational frontline therapy for COVID-19” aims to shed light on the discovery and function of ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). The lecture will also cover the relationship between ACE2 and renin–angiotensin system (RAS) – a hormone system responsible for systemic vascular resistance and for regulating blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance – in instances of lung injury. Furthermore, the lecture will highlight the predisposition of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.

Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV.

Scientists demonstrate how COVID-19 infects human cells

Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Protein modeling experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of human cells to use them as a mechanism of cell entry.

COVID-19’s Spikes Bind at ACE2 Receptors

Viruses have co-evolved with us, using proteins that jut from our cell surfaces. HIV and West Nile virus enter through CCR5 receptors, which dot white blood cells. Influenza viruses bind sialic acid residues. Coxsackievirus and adenovirus target part of an antibody. And herpes simplex uses 3 different doorways.

COVID-19 latches onto angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, aka ACE2.

To us, ACE2 is an enzyme that has an effect on blood pressure.

To COVID-19, ACE2 is a receptor, an entranceway, in the airways and alveoli (air sacs) as well as in blood vessel linings. ACE2 is also a receptor for SARS-CoV and NL63-CoV. (MERS-CoV uses a different receptor.)

The key to developing vaccines and treatments is the three-dimensional shapes of the parts of the virus that contact our cells.

SARS and NL63-CoV bind to a helical part of ACE2 that snakes up from cell membranes, forming distinctive tunnels and bridges that comprise a “hot spot” for viruses. The attraction of a virus to a cell receptor hot spot is a little like a tired commuter emerging from a subway station and seeing a Starbucks sign, moving towards the coffee shop as if dragged by a tractor beam. The viral hot spot that beckons both SARS and COVID-19 is a shared drug and vaccine target – and so all the work on developing a SARS vaccine is now in the spotlight.

Researchers knew from SARS that the S1 parts of the viral spikes hug the ACE2 receptor at a region of five amino acids (protein building blocks). Even though four of the amino acids  differ in COVID-19, they are similar in size and charge to their counterparts in SARS.

If S1 attaches SARS to the ACE2 receptor like a boat docking, would COVID-9 tie up at exactly the same points?

Teaming a traditional crystal structure approach with computational methods, Pei Hao, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and colleagues modeled the interface, showing that COVID-19 indeed binds ACE2 just like SARS does, with slightly less force. In a Letter to the Editor of Science China Life Sciences, they conclude that the new virus “poses a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S-protein-ACE2 binding pathway.”

Even more recently, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease used electron microscopy to zero in on a “pre-fusion” spike protein triplet nearing the receptor. They imaged one of the three spikies rotating upward to latch onto the receptor, revealing precisely where a vaccine must fit. The work is published in Science.
