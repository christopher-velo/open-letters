A few sample references demonstrating current view on COVID-19 transmission vector.

".. the predisposition of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV receptor."

".. the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor."

Professor Penninger’s lecture “ACE2 – a rational frontline therapy for COVID-19” aims to shed light on the discovery and function of ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). The lecture will also cover the relationship between ACE2 and renin–angiotensin system (RAS) – a hormone system responsible for systemic vascular resistance and for regulating blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance – in instances of lung injury. Furthermore, the lecture will highlight the predisposition of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.

Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV.

Scientists demonstrate how COVID-19 infects human cells
Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Protein modeling experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of human cells to use them as a mechanism of cell entry.



COVID-19 Vaccine Will Close in on the Spikes

"Viruses have co-evolved with us, using proteins that jut from our cell surfaces. HIV and West Nile virus enter through CCR5 receptors, which dot white blood cells. Influenza viruses bind sialic acid residues. Coxsackievirus and adenovirus target part of an antibody. And herpes simplex uses 3 different doorways.

ACE2 raises blood pressure in us, but is a receptor for COVID-19.
COVID-19 latches onto angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, aka ACE2."
